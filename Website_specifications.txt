==Overview==
The website OpenGÁTA is developed by project group Gáta, comprised of BSc Computational Social Science students at the University of Amsterdam.
The goal of this website is to explain OpenKAT - a cybersecurity tool developed by the Dutch Ministry of Health -
in layman's terms, in order to make it more accessible/marketable. 
Two variations of this website have been made to be used in A/B testing, one featuring OpenKAT's design language,
where the B version's design bears more similarities to that of a "traditional" cybersecurity tool.
The team has written all the of the HTML/CSS code from scratch - apart from some snippets of code from external sources,
and adapted the Python Flask code provided to them, in order to track the time spent on specific pages,
as well as the buttons users click and how often they do so.
The website is targeted at both the IT department of healthcare organisations, as well as the board of these organisations, 
in order to make OpenKAT more easily understandable/marketable.


==Team==
Project group Gáta consists of the following members, all students of the BSc Computational Social Science at UvA:

==Objectives==
The goal of this website is to explain OpenKAT - a cybersecurity tool developed by the Dutch Ministry of Health -
in layman's terms, in order to make it more accessible/marketable.

==Content==
Phase 1 - Basic explanatory website of OpenKAT, using easy-to-understand language - Completed
Phase 2 - Addition of step-by-step OpenKAT installation guide and video tutorials


==Design==
See Gáta Project Report Appendix C


==Functionality==
The website runs on a Python Flask server, that is also responsible for the user tracking.
This tracking is done based on a randomly generated user ID that should be added in the URL upon first visit in order to work.
The ID is added in the following syntax: [website.url]/?uid=[ID] where the sections in square brackets depend on the implementation.


==Browser support==
The website should be compatible with most modern browsers, as of writing on the 8th of June 2023.
Support from mobile devices is built-in, however the best user experience is still on a desktop or laptop.


==Web hosting==
The website is required to be hosted with a hosting provider capable of hosting Python Flask applications, however the webpages
could theoretically be reverted back to their original pure HTML/CSS form if needed.
